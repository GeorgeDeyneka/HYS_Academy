### Which one do you prefer?
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
So, you have reached the next section with the slider. I wrote it without using any third party libraries.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
      It is worth noting that the animation of all interaction elements on the page, whether it be sliders or pagination, is written in the same style. This helps maintain the overall style of the project and allows the application to look cohesive.
    </li>
      </br>
    <li>
So, in this slider you can change the Album categories, which automatically changes the data received from the server. The images and text of the slides are taken from the provided API.
    </li>
  </ul>

### Our great customers
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
The next section provides a simple pagination. It is also written without the use of third party libraries.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
You can see the image, background color and text change. By the way, I had the freedom of imagination in the choice of text content, so I gave quotes from famous world cinema masterpieces.
    </li>
  </ul>

### Latest blog, form
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
Here is the last section of the site - pagination and a form to fill out.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
The pagination shows two elements and also has a smooth animation transition.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
The form has validation, so you can fill it out without any problems. As you fill out the form, you will see prompts
what data the form expects.
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
When you click the "Submit" button, the data from the form will be submitted and you will see a modal window with the words of thanks. Try filling out and submitting the form, it's very easy!
    </li>
    </br>
    <li>
Also pay attention to the accessibility of the project and the styling of the focus on each individual element when using the site using the keyboard.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </br>
