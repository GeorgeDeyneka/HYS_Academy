## About project

This is my landing page, written with TypeScript and assembled by the Gulp builder. The SCSS preprocessor was used to style the project. It is well optimized for different devices as it uses responsive design and is written using the Mobile First technique.

Also pay attention to the accessibility of the project and the styling of the focus on each individual element when using the site using the keyboard.
